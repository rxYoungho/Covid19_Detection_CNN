# Please Read before you run the code

Please Download the CT_Scans_detection folder as it is, and unzip it.

When you unzip the file, open "Covid(CT)_detection.py".

You must download appropriate weight to run the machine.

I will provide the weight I have trained for this model in the following link(The file exceeds 25MB).

After you download the weight file, make sure you put it in the "obj_detection" folder where the names and cfg files are before you run the code.
